TASK 3: Dice Roller
  Create a simple dice rolling app that simulates rolling a pair of dice.
  
  
  
Features:
  The app should have a clean and user-friendly interface.
  It should allow users to select the number of dice they want to roll.
  It should simulate rolling the dice and display the result.
  It should allow users to roll the dice again or quit the app.
  
  
Steps to create the project:
  1. Open a new Python file in your favourite text editor or IDE. 2. Define a function roll_dice() that simulates rolling a pair of dice.
  3. Use the random module to generate random numbers between 1 and 6 to simulate the dice rolls.
  4. Implement the logic for allowing the user to select the number of dice they want to roll. 
  5. Implement the logic for displaying the result of the dice rolls.
  6. Allow users to roll the dice again or quit the app.
  7. Test the app by running the Python file in your terminal or console.
